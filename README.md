# Ellipse
---
    Class for representation geometric figure ellipse in squere.
    Contains two fields (Point2D) of rectangle's coordinates.
    Class Point2D include two coordinates of point in squere.
    
## Plans
---
1. Entity classes:
    + Point2D
    + Ellipse
0. Creators for entity objects
0. Action classes:
    +   Calculate squere of ellipse
    +   Calculate perimeter of ellipse
0. Validate files;
0. Reade files;
0. Parse data;
0. Validate data;
0. Handle exceptions:
    + The coordinates of points must be positive 
    + The points (of rectangle) must make an ellipse?
